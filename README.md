# Java Projects :- 

## 1. Online Reservation System
### The online reservation system we will build will be a simple console-based application that allows users to make, view, and cancel reservations. We will use the following components to build the system: Reservation Class, Reservation System Class and User Interface. 
Reservation class will represent a reservation and will have properties like name, date, and number of guests.
